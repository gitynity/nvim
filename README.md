- packer plugin manager is used to install the plugins.

- init.lua is the main file where we call all plugins at neovim startup.

- lua directory contains individual plugin files and a common import file for all plugins called plugins.lua.

##### Note: Make sure not to keep the name of the plugin file same as the name of plugin, it can cause integration issues at nvim startup. 

##### For example, name of mason plugin file can be mason-config.lua instead of mason.lua. <br /> <br />  <br />
